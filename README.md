# 🎓 AI-Based Educational Performance Prediction Web App

This project is an AI-powered web application that predicts **Promotion Rate** and **Dropout Rate** in schools based on infrastructure and digital facility availability. Built using Flask and trained on real-world educational data, the model supports data-driven decision-making aligned with **SDG 4: Quality Education**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Many schools in India and globally still face infrastructure gaps — from lack of toilets to poor digital access — that directly affect student performance. This application:

- Accepts infrastructure availability as input (%)
- Predicts likely **promotion** and **dropout** rates
- Aims to support policymakers and educators with actionable insights

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Local Setup)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edu-predictor.git
cd edu-predictor
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
Make sure you have Python ≥3.7 installed.
```bash
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn
```

### 3. (Optional) Train the model again
```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will regenerate `prom_model.pkl` and `drop_model.pkl`.

### 4. Launch the app locally
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🌐 Deployment

This Flask app can be deployed on:

- **Render.com** (free)
- **Heroku** (deprecated free tier)
- **Vercel** (with serverless function wrap)
- **Local server or Docker**

For Render:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to Render → New Web Service
3. Set build command to:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python train_model.py
   ```
4. Start command:
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:app
   ```

## 📈 Model Used

### Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Chosen for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear patterns between input features and performance metrics.

#### Promotion Rate Model
- **MAE**: 2.95
- **RMSE**: 3.31
- **R²**: 0.03

#### Dropout Rate Model
- **MAE**: 1.97
- **RMSE**: 2.49
- **R²**: 0.10

These results indicate decent prediction capability for this scale of input.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Add prediction for **Transition Rate** and **Repetition Rate**
- Enhance UI with interactive charts (Plotly/Chart.js)
- Deploy publicly via Render/Netlify
- Add **feature importance plots** and **visual explanations (e.g., SHAP)**

---

## ✅ SDG 4 Alignment

This project supports **Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education** by:

- Identifying gaps in infrastructure
- Predicting student outcomes based on those gaps
- Enabling data-driven planning for equitable learning access
